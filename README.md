This is an End to End Project where a web app is created to show how the model works and
interacts with the front end structure.

The Dataset was Taken from kaggle.The original Dataset was too large(25GB),so i used a small image dataset

The screenshot of the web app are given below:
![Web app](screenshots/pic1.png)

The above webpage accepts a image from any directory and then based
on that image recommends similar fashion accessories.

The output will be somthing like this:
![Web app](screenshots/pic2.png)

The Model was trained using ResNet50 with imagenet dataset
and KNN algorithm was used to find the closest images.
